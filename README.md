# Dog Breed Classifier
## Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Topic: Deep learning

### Description

The aim of this project is to develop a an algorithm that accepts any user-supplied image as input, determines whether the image contains a dog and predicts it's breed. If a human is detected, it provides an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The breed classification part of the algorithm is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. 

### Data

A dataset of 8351 images of dogs (133 different breeds) has been used in order to train and test the Convolutional Neural Network that was developed.
